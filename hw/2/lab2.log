tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
    replaces each non-alphabetic character with a newline

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
    replaces each group of contiguous non-alphabetic characters with a newline

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
    alphabetically sorts the words (groups of contiguous alphabetic
    characters) in the file, with each word on its own line

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
    does the same as the previous command, but de-dupes the output; i.e. each
    word is only displayed once

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
    prints three columns - words only in the HTML page, words only in the
    wordlist, and words in common between the two

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
    prints words in the HTML page that are not in the wordlist
