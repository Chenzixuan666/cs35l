Q3: IndexError: list index out of range
This happens because the Python random.choice function expects a list with
at least one item. Line 273 of this function attempts to access an element
in the list using bracket notation. Since there are no elements in the list,
trying to access an item at any index will raise an IndexError.

Q4: SyntaxError: invalid syntax (on line 65 of randline.py)
This happens because syntax for error handling in the "except" block changed
in Python 3. Python 3 no longer allows comma syntax, only "except ErrorType
as exc:". See: https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3110
