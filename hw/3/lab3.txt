# applying the patch

copy the patch from the linked website into a file named "brady.patch"
attempt to apply the patch: patch -p1 < ./brady.patch
ran into an error: patch: **** malformed patch at line 11: outline -*-
removed comment on lines 11-13
re-run: patch -p1 < ./brady.patch (succeeds this time)


recompile with make && make install
run ./build/bin/ls -l again, verify that the issue is fixed

Q1: Brady's patch removed "case_long_iso_time_style:" because it didn't do
anything useful. The line above it, "case long_iso_time_style:", is the line
that was actually necessary. The code still worked properly because control
flow "fell through", but the "case_long_iso_time_style:" line was unnecessary.

Q2: Brady's patch removes code that uses the user's locale format, so it is
no longer properly localized.
