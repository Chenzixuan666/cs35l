Created a 64-bit Ubuntu 14.10 instance, downloaded the key pair
Connected to instance with ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@52.11.197.229
Tried to install gcc, ran into an error, ran sudo apt-get update
Installed gcc and make with sudo apt-get update
Used wget to download file, uncompressed it
Ran ./configure && make
Changed maxsize_expansion and size_expansion_times_4 in sample patch to
80 and 100, respectively.
Run the server, get the process id, attach gdb to it. Run wget with a long URL
and backtrace shows the following error:

Vulnerabilities

VU#695940: regex overflow vulnerability
low: the attacker would first have to gain access to the web server in order
to take advantage of this vulnerability. Additionally, the impact of the
vulnerability is not clear, but probably means it's not being rampantly
exploited in the wild.

VU#787252: Windows group policy authentication
high: "a remote, unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary code and
completely compromise vulnerable systems" is about as bad as it gets. This
vulnerability should be patched immediately.

VU#967332: C library buffer overflow
high: this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution, and its
access complexity is low. Authentication is not required to carry out the
exploit.

VU#976132: securing Resume Boot Path script
low: the attack must be carried out by an authenticated local attacker. If
said attacker existed, the results could be catastrophic, but authentication
significantly increases the attack complexity.

VU#252743: bash remote execution
high: the attack complexity is extremely low and anything running bash (which
is pretty much any linux-based server) is affected. The vulnerability can
be exploited without authentication.
