Generate a file with random floating-point numbers:

od -f < /dev/urandom | cut -d " " -f 2- | sed -e 's/[[:space:]]\+/\n/g' |\
sed -e '/^$/d' > random.txt

What this command does is: takes output /dev/urandom, formats it as floating
point with od. Uses cut to remove the first column, which contains a
sequentially incrementing integer. Replace blocks of whitespace with newlines,
and remove the extra newline between each group of numbers.

Let it run for about 30 seconds on the SEASnet server, then CTRL-C to stop it.

Truncate the file to exactly 10,000,000 lines with:
sed -i '10000001,$ d' random.txt (removes lines after 10,000,000)
