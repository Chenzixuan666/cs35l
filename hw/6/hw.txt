1. Yes, the network is still secure because only the public keys have been
transmitted over the network and the attacker cannot decrypt any data over
the network without a private.

If they had tapped the keyboard, this method would still be secure because
the private data (private key) is generated and is not a result of keyboard
entry.

If they had physical control of the media on which the OS was running, this
method would not be secure because the attacker could presumably view the
private key or even tamper with the mechanism by which the keys are generated.

2. gpg --verify only checks if the signature matches the tar file, but it
doesn't check who actually created the tar file. To solve this problem and
actually verify the key, you would have to track who you received the public
key from. For example, if you trusted a person, you could physically meet them
in person to get their public key. In this case, you could be "sure" that
the key was valid.
