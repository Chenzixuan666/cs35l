3. strace analysis

catb.c, when writing to standard output, reads the entire file into memory in
one system call and writes it out one line at a time. When run with another
file as output, it reads input in chunks of size 4096 at a time, sixteen
times, before writing an output of size 65536 (4096*16 = 65536).

catu.c, when writing to standard output, alternates between reading and
writing single characters at a time. It exhibits the same behavior when
writing to a file.


4. time results

catb.c, tested on /usr/share/dict/words
real	0m1.899s
user	0m0.198s
sys	    0m0.795s

catb.c, tested on /usr/share/dict/words
real	0m5.771s
user	0m0.225s
sys	    0m5.538s


When used on larger files, it becomes clear that catb.c is more efficient
because it reads and writes characters in larger chunks than catu.c, resulting
in fewer total system calls.
